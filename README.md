Raster-Zoo is part of the PredictiveWorks. project family and aims to seamlessly integrate imagery data from drones 
and satellites with deep learning. Use cases are image classification (including location), segmentation and object 
detection.

For the described goal, Raster-Zoo integrates two outstanding open source projects: **RasterFrames** from 
Astraae and, **Analytics-Zoo** from Intel. This results in configurable, code-free deep learning pipelines 
for training and inference phases.

PredictiveWorks. is a declarative AI factory to turn AI solutions from artisanal hand-crafted AI products into industrial
assets, that can be produced on demand and just in time. 

From a functional perspective, PredictiveWorks. is made to support **the entire AI triad**, from data to models and solutions 
with a single platform and technology.

From a data perspective, PredictiveWorks. has a strong focus on the combination of sensor, imagery and security data 
(i.e. endpoint and traffic data) to **support multi-step AI applications**, from smart & secure agriculture, city, industry  to 
and energy.
